sublime_2_enumerate
===================

Simple, but handy plugin to enumerate your lists, or whatever.
Select places, run plugin and enjoy number sequence starting from 1.

I bound it as:

    { "keys": ["ctrl+alt+n"], "command": "numerate" }

So, when I need to add numbers to lines:

1. Select lines with shift+down;
2. Press "ctrl+shift+L" to split selection;
3. Press "ctrl+alt+n" to add numbers.

Or

1. Select lines with ctrl+alt+down;
2. Press "ctrl+alt+n" to add numbers.
3. Bob's your uncle!
